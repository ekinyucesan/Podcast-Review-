Podcast Ratings and Categories Analysis

This project examines how podcast topics influence listener satisfaction. Using over two million reviews from the Podcast Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)
and a categories.json taxonomy exported from ListenNotes, the analysis investigates whether certain podcast categories receive higher ratings or more positive review sentiment.

Research Question:
-Do the production characteristics of podcasts—such as their category, release frequency, and country of origin—affect how positively listeners rate or review them?

I'm planing to use these two datasets from Kaggle:
1)All Podcast Episodes Published in December 2017 (Kaggle) — meta data of podcast episodes from December 2017 (~121k podcasts, ~881k episodes)
2) Reviews (Kaggle) — ~2 million reviews for ~100k podcasts (review text, ratings, etc.).

These two datasets are complementary for this project. While the first dataset is providing Production mostly topics, countries, languages, release behavior second dataset will support it with reviews,ratings and sentiments.

Here are some subquestions to analyze in this project:

Do some podcast categories receive higher average listener ratings?
Are certain genres (e.g., Education, Technology) more likely to have positive review sentiment?
Is review text length or emotional tone correlated with genre?

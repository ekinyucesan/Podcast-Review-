Podcast Ratings and Categories Analysis

This project examines how podcast topics influence listener satisfaction. Using over two million reviews from the Podcast Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)
and a categories.json taxonomy exported from ListenNotes, the analysis investigates whether certain podcast categories receive higher ratings or more positive review sentiment.

Research Question
Do podcasts in specific categories (such as Technology, Comedy, or Business) achieve higher listener ratings and sentiment compared to others?
